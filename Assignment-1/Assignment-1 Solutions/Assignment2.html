    <h1>Patrick Young</h1>
    <p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming o stanford, I spend two years as a programmer at a Taligent(Now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Place for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small projects teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams Product throughout an entire software lifecycle --from initial product conceptions through the actual product launch. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have PH.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in the Software Engineering. My Dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams. I also have master's degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and Bachelors Degree's in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.<br><br><strong>This text is bold</strong><br><em>While this one is Italic</em><br><u>This text is Underlined</u><br><strong><em>Look at this, This is both bold and Italic</em></strong><br><br>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acetate<br>MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanganate<br>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dichromate<br>CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chromate<br>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peroxide<br><br>(x + y)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy + y<sup>2</sup><br>(x - y)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> - 2xy + y<sup>2</sup><br>x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> = (x - y)(x + y)<br>(x + a)(x + b) = x<sup>2</sup> + (a + b)x + ab
